        <h3>Welcome</h3>
        <p>This site is a simple three page HTML5 website built for class. The goal is to practice structure, semantic elements, and linking between pages without worrying about design.</p>
        <p>I’m building this like a mini professional homepage: who I am, what I’m about, and a few things I’m working on.</p>
        <p>My main focus is learning by doing. If something breaks, I want to understand why it broke and how to fix it in a clean way instead of just guessing.</p>
        <p>As the semester goes on, I’ll keep expanding the content so the pages feel more like a real portfolio rather than a template.</p>

        <p>I like keeping a reminder around that pushes consistency, especially when motivation is not there.</p>
