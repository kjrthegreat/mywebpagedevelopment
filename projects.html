        <h3>What I’m Working On</h3>
        <p>This page lists a few areas I’m interested in. The point is to use semantic structure (headings, paragraphs, and lists) instead of relying on visuals.</p>
        <p>Most of my projects connect back to practical IT skills: understanding networks, building clean web pages, and getting better at troubleshooting.</p>
        <p>Over time, I want this page to turn into a real portfolio with links, screenshots, and short write-ups that explain what I built and what I learned.</p>

        <h3>Current Focus Areas</h3>
        <p>These are the main areas I’m focusing on right now. I’m trying to build a strong foundation before I worry about advanced features or flashy design.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Networking basics:</strong> learning how devices communicate and how to diagnose issues.</li>
          <li><strong>Web fundamentals:</strong> building clean HTML structure that actually means something.</li>
          <li><strong>Troubleshooting:</strong> testing, measuring, and making changes one at a time.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section id="resources">
        <h3>Learning Resources</h3>
        <p>When I get stuck, I usually go straight to documentation before I go to random forum answers. It helps me understand what the technology is supposed to do.</p>
