        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>My name is Kyle Rybarczyk. I’m an ICT student at the University of Kentucky. I like learning by doing: building projects, testing settings, and figuring out why something works (or why it doesn’t).</p>
        <p>Outside of class, I’m into gaming and performance tuning, which has honestly taught me a lot about troubleshooting and being detail oriented.</p>
        <p>I’m the type of person who would rather test one change at a time and measure results than blindly copy settings from the internet.</p>

        <h2>How I Work</h2>
        <p>When I run into a problem, I try to break it down into smaller parts. I’ll start with the simplest explanation first, then work toward the more technical possibilities.</p>
        <p>I also like documenting what I changed so I don’t end up chasing my own tail and repeating the same mistakes.</p>

        <h2>Strengths I Try to Use</h2>
        <p>I tend to stay focused when I have a goal in front of me. I like competition and measurable progress, which pushes me to keep improving.</p>
        <p>Here are a few strengths I try to lean on when I’m working or learning something new.</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Strategic thinking: planning steps instead of guessing</li>
          <li>Responsibility: finishing what I start</li>
          <li>Restorative mindset: fixing problems instead of avoiding them</li>
        </ol>
